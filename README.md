# CNCF Strategy Plan

Private monorepo for planning, staging, and release kits. See `docs/` for the narrative and specs.

## Layout
- `docs/` — specifications, guidelines, and change report template
- `scripts/` — build/run helpers (YAML and shell)
- `kits/` — approver/promote/change-review/git-integration kits (archives preserved)
- `starters/` — starter templates (archive preserved)
- `staging/` — derived artifacts only (do not hand-edit)
- `.build/` — manifests and caches

## Getting Started
See `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` for local dev and commit conventions.
